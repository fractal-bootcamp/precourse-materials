### What's the question?

### What is a browser?

A web browser is an application for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen. 

### What is an event? What is an event handler?

An event is a signal that something has happened in the web browser or the surrounding environment. These signals can originate from various sources like:
- User interactions: Clicking buttons, typing in forms, scrolling the page, hovering over elements, etc.
- Browser actions: Page loading, window resizing, network requests completing, etc.
- DOM changes: Elements being added, removed, or modified dynamically within the web page.

An event handler is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function) that is designed to respond to a specific event. When a particular event occurs, the corresponding event handler is triggered, and its code is executed.

### What does DOM stand for? What is the structure of the DOM?

DOM stands for **Document Object Model**. It's a programming interface that represents a web page's structure and content as a tree of objects. This tree structure allows scripting languages like JavaScript to access and manipulate the web page dynamically.

The DOM structure:

- Root Node: This is the topmost node in the tree, representing the entire document. In HTML, it's usually the <html> element.
- Element Nodes: These nodes represent the HTML elements that make up the content and structure of the web page. Examples include <div>, <p>, <h1>, etc. Each element node has attributes and properties associated with it.
- Text Nodes: These nodes represent the actual textual content within the element nodes.
- Comment Nodes: These nodes represent comments embedded within the HTML code, which are ignored by the browser but can be useful for developers.
- Child Nodes: Each element node can have child nodes, which can be other element nodes, text nodes, or comment nodes. This creates a hierarchical tree structure.


### How do you interact with the DOM?

Some key methods for DOM interaction:

- **getElementById**: Retrieves an element by its unique ID attribute.
- **getElementsByTagName**: Retrieves a collection of elements with a specific tag name.
- **getElementsByClassName**: Retrieves a collection of elements with a specific class name.
- **querySelector**: Selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector (more versatile than the previous methods).
- **createElement**: Creates a new HTML element node.
- **appendChild**: Appends a child node to another element node.
- **removeChild**: Removes a child node from an element.
- **setAttribute**: Sets an attribute value for an element.
- **getAttribute**: Gets the value of an attribute for an element.
- **innerText/textContent**: Sets or gets the text content of an element.
- **addEventListener**: Attaches an event listener to an element to respond to user interactions or other events.

### What does HTML stand for? What is it? Why is it important?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the foundation for creating web pages and is the essential language that browsers understand to render the content and structure we see on the web.

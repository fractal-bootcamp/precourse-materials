# STATE MANAGEMENT

## QUESTIONS

- What is state in react? Why is state management important?
  State is an object that houses data that changes over time in an application. State management is important because it is essential in displaying what is shown and stored
- What is context? When would you use it?
  Context is a way to pass data between parent and child components. We would use it when we want to share state between components that don't necessarily rely on each other.

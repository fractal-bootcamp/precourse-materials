# STATE MANAGEMENT
## QUESTIONS
### What is state in react? Why is state management important?
State is a built in object that contains data about the component and is dynamic, meaning it can change over time. It allows you to track and manage data in the component, and allows for your components to be responsive and interactive. State management is important because it determines how data flows in the application and determines its behavior, including impacting interactivity, data handling, performance and debugging possibilities.

### What is context? When would you use it?
Context is an API that allows you to share values across all levels of a component tree without having to explicity pass props down through every level. It is useful when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels, such as for UI themes and user preferences.

# STATE MANAGEMENT

## QUESTIONS

- What is state in react? Why is state management important?
  - State is dynamic data storage that lets components track & respond to changing 
    information. It provides dynamic interactivity for modern web apps, allows for 
    component re-rendering and encapsulation keeping data and logic bundled within 
    their respective components.
- What is context? When would you use it?
  - It's a way to share data across many components without having to pass props manually 
    at every level. It's similar to a global variable but scoped to a part of the 
    component tree.

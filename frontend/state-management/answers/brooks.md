- What is state in react? Why is state management important?

State is data that a component keeps track of and can change over time (like input values, counters, loading states). Without proper state management, your UI can get out of sync with your data. It also gets hard to coordinate changes across multiple components.

- What is context? When would you use it?

Context is a way to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level.

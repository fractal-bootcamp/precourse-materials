# REACT

## QUESTIONS

- What is a prop?
short for property, a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. read-only, allows components to be reusable by receiving different values or configs from parents.
- What is a hook? Can you explain what the built in hooks are, and when you would use them?
a special function that lets us use react features like state and lifecycle methods inside functions/components. examples include useState (for management component state) and useEffect (for performing side effects like data fetching).
- What is a component? Why are components important?
a self-contained reusable piece of UI that defines how a part of the interface looks and works. they allow developers to break down complex UIs into small and manageable pieces. this promotes reusability and easier debugging. 
- What is JSX?
javascript XML (JSX) is an extension for JS that is similar to HTML. it is used in react to describe what the UI should look like and write HTML like code directly within JS. it is compiled into regular JS by tools like Babel. 

## ADVANCED

- What are some of the differences between React, Svelte, and Angular? Why are they important?
there are various pros and cons to the 'institutions' that are these different frameworks. they are structured in different ways - some more complex others more simple. some require plugins and an active community while others are more self-standing. angular is an older google framework that frankly seems pretty clunky from every experience I've had with it. React is a Meta made framework that i think is by far the most popular for building web-apps. svelte is a newer framework that is very performant but has a smaller community behind it, and apparently doesn't support typescript.

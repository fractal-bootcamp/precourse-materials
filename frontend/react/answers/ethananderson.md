# REACT

## QUESTIONS

- What is a prop?
  - A prop is any property that belongs to an object
- What is a hook? Can you explain what the built in hooks are, and when you would use them?
  - A hook is a special function for managing state, side effects, etc. They're used 
    when you want to hook into a specific feature of React. Makes a functional 
    component as powerful as a class component with simpler code.
- What is a component? Why are components important?
  - A component is a resuable object or section of your website/code. It creates a 
    more efficient way of organizing your code that's easier to scale, share and rapidly 
    prototype.
- What is JSX?
  - JSX is 'JavaScript syntax extension' that looks like HTML. It describes the 
    UI within the React component. It allows you to write 
    HTML-like syntax with JS logic all within the 
    same file, keeping the code easier to read and self-contained. It's transpiled to regular JavaScript later in the process.

## ADVANCED

- What are some of the differences between React, Svelte, and Angular? Why are they important?
  - React is a JS Library that uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI. It 
    uses JSX for its component structure. It has builtin hooks, but relies on external 
    libraries for complex state mgmt. It focuses on the UI and has a huge ecosystem.
  - Svelte is a compiler. It converts components in highly optimized JS at build time. 
    There's no virtual DOM. It uses HTML-like syntax and is very close to vanilla JS & 
    HTML. It has the smallest ecosystem of the three.
  - Angular uses a real DOM with change detection and provides routing, HTTP, out of 
    the box. The learning curve is steep and it has lots of concepts and boilerplate. 
    It's considered a full framework.

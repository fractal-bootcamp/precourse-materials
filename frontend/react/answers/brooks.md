- What is a prop?

Props are inputs passed from a parent component to a child. They let you customize or control components.

- What is a hook? Can you explain what the built in hooks are, and when you would use them?

Hooks let you use React features (like state and lifecycle) in function components.

useState = for state
useEffect = for side effects (fetching, subscriptions)
useContext = access context values
useRef = store a mutable value that doesn’t trigger re-renders
useMemo, useCallback = optimization

- What is a component? Why are components important?

A reusable piece of UI. Everything in React is made of components — they help break UIs into small, testable, and manageable parts.

- What is JSX?

JSX = JavaScript + XML
It lets you write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.

## ADVANCED

- What are some of the differences between React, Svelte, and Angular? Why are they important?

React = Uses a virtual DOM, Functional, component-based, flexible, but more boilerplate
Svelte = Compiles to optimized JS — no virtual DOM, Very fast, less code
Angular = Full framework with built-in routing, HTTP, etc. More opinionated and structured

Its important to know the differences in order to determine which to use.

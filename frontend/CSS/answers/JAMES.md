# CSS

## QUESTIONS

- What does CSS stand for? What is it used for?
  - cascading style sheets. It is used to provide design, color, typography, padding, etc. to the html document.
- What is a CSS pre-processor? Can you give some examples?
  - I believe a pre-processor is a way to compile the css into more machine readable and formatted styling? I could be wrong. Some examples... not sure...
  - clarification: a pre-processor allows programmers to write code in a specific syntax and then have it compiled into standard css and allows us features not available in css like variables, nesting and mixins. Some common examples are Sass and LESS.
- What is a CSS framework? Can you give some examples?
  - a CSS framework abstracts the complexities of CSS into better, more usable and maintainable code so that we can quickly and easily update and change styling without getting lost in the detail of formatting and syntax.
  - an early one I used was called bootstrap and one I've used recently is called TailwindCSS.
  - Update, the downside is that it could add bloat to the codebase or limiting creative flexibility by relying on the frameworks design patterns.

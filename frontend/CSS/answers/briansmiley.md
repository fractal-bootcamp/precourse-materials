# CSS

## QUESTIONS

### What does CSS stand for? What is it used for?

Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language used to specify myriad display/rendering details for html content like colors, size and positioning of text and other elements, etc.

### What is a CSS pre-processor? Can you give some examples?

CSS pre-processors take code that specifies CSS using a wider array of programming tools than baseline CSS, like loops, variables, and conditional flow-control, and compile it into corresponding CSS that can be used by the browser. SASS and LESS are two examples.

### What is a CSS framework? Can you give some examples?

CSS frameworks specify pre-defined classes and constructs to add sophisticated styling options without needing to write them from scratch, and for easier consistency reproducibility across projects/teams. Tailwind and Bootstrap seem to be popular examples. Redditors seem to mostly think you shouldn't use these unless your particular project circumstances require it.

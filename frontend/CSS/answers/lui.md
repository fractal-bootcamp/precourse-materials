### What does CSS stand for? What is it used for? 

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language that defines how elements in HTML and XML will be displayed. CSS lets you define specifications for layout, colors, fonts, and more.

### What is a CSS pre-processor? Can you give some examples?

A CSS pre-processor is a scripting language that extends the default capabilities of CSS with features like...
- variables
- nested rules
- mixins
- functions

These pre-processors allow for more dynamic and modular stylesheet writing. The pre-processed code is then compiled into standard CSS format that can be understood by browsers.

Examples of CSS pre-processors:

- Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets): Provides a more powerful and elegant syntax that allows for cleaner code with things like variables and nested rules.
- LESS (Leaner Style Sheets): Similar to Sass but uses JavaScript for its backend processing.
- Stylus: Offers great flexibility and an expressive syntax without the strictness of curly braces or semicolons.

### What is a CSS framework? Can you give some examples?

A CSS framework is a library that is allows for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the CSS language. It provides a basic structure for building websites and will typically include:
- grid systems
- responsive designs for mobile and desktop
- style templates for typography
- buttons
- forms
This reduces the amount of CSS a developer has to write from scratch.

Examples of popular CSS frameworks include:

- Bootstrap: One of the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS frameworks for developing responsive and mobile-first projects on the web.
- Foundation: Developed by ZURB, itâ€™s a sophisticated framework that provides HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools for making responsive websites and apps.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first framework that is highly customizable, allowing developers to style their applications by composing utility classes directly in HTML.
- Bulma: Another modern CSS framework based solely on Flexbox, known for its simplicity and ease of use.

What is a database (DB)?
A database is a systematic way of storing information so data can be accessed, analyzed, transformed, updated and moved with efficiency.
Data stored in databases follows certain conventions of formatting such as data types (JSON, text, etc.) and specific fields like name, email, date of birth, etc. This structured approach makes searching and organizing information more efficient and safe because we're less likely to accidentally erase or lose data when it's organized.

What is a column? A row? A table? What do these represent?
A column is a vertical space, a row is a horizontal space, and a table is a space made out of rows and columns. This creates a coordinate system where we can locate information reliably using coordinates.
Conceptually, a row represents a single object/entity, a column represents a key/property of that object, and a table represents an array of similar objects. Rows and columns have headers that standardize what data can go where, ensuring consistent data structure.

What is a primary key? Why is it important?
A primary key is a unique ID that each object/entity/record gets assigned, typically generated by the database itself. It's important because with a unique ID we can efficiently find a particular entry and ensure we delete/update/reference the correct record. This prevents errors like accidentally modifying the wrong data when there are similar or duplicate values in other fields.

What is the difference between a SQL DB, NoSQL DB, and Graph DB?
SQL databases are a collection of tables with rows and columns. Accessing structured data is made most flexible and efficient by relational database technology. They work well for applications like e-commerce, banking, and HR systems.
NoSQL databases handle unstructured and semi-structured data. They are highly scalable and flexible, making them ideal for real-time applications. The prevalence and complexity of online applications led to the rise in popularity of NoSQL databases. Examples include social media, big data analytics, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications.
Graph databases prioritize relationships between data objects. They use nodes (data entities) and edges (relationships) to model data. They're ideal for social networks, recommendation systems, and fraud detection where relationships are as important as the data itself.

What is data persistence? Why is it important?
Data persistence means the data stays stored until we delete it or modify it. It's not going away with re-renders or system restarts. It's important because we need to reference and revisit this data over time, so it needs to be stable. Without data persistence, businesses and applications would face catastrophic consequences.

What is a data model?
A database model shows the logical structure of a database. It defines the relationships and rules that determine how data can be stored, organized, and manipulated. Each database application is built on a specific data model. Individual database models are designed based on the rules and concepts of the broader data model that the underlying application adopts.

What is an ORM?
An ORM, or Object Relational Mapper, is a piece of software designed to translate between the data representations used by databases and those used in object-oriented programming. Basically, these two ways of working with data don't naturally fit together, so an ORM attempts to bridge the gap between the two systems' data designs.

What is 3rd Normal Form (3NF)?
3rd Normal Form (3NF) is a database normalization rule that ensures every piece of data in a table depends directly on the primary key, and nothing but the primary key. It eliminates "transitive dependencies" where data depends on other non-key columns rather than the primary key itself. For example, if InstructorEmail depends on InstructorName rather than the primary key, this violates 3NF. The solution is to move related data into separate tables and reference them by ID, eliminating redundancy and update anomalies.

What are the three types of relationships in a relational database, and what’s the difference between them?
The three types are One-to-One (1:1), One-to-Many (1:M), and Many-to-Many (M:M).
One-to-One (1:1): Each record in Table A connects to exactly one record in Table B. Example: Person ↔ Passport. Implementation uses a foreign key in either table.
One-to-Many (1:M): One record in Table A can connect to many records in Table B, but each record in Table B connects to only one record in Table A. Example: Teacher → Students. The foreign key goes on the "many" side.
Many-to-Many (M:M): Many records in Table A can connect to many records in Table B. Example: Students ↔ Courses. Requires a separate junction table with foreign keys to both original tables.

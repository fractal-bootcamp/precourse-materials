- What is business logic vs UI logic?

Business logic = rules that define how the system behaves (e.g. how orders are processed, how users are billed)
UI logic = controls what the user sees and interacts with (e.g. showing/hiding buttons, formatting dates)

- What does MVC stand for, and why is it important?

MVC = Model View Controller

Model = Handles data and rules
View = Displays the data
Controller = Takes user inputs and coordinates between model and view

This keeps code modular and easier to test, maintain, and scale.

- What is a service?

A service contains reusable business logic. Sits between the controller and the database

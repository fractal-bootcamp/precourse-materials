# Git Fundamentals
***

* What is git? Why do we need it?
  * Git is a free & open source distributed version control system to track changes to 
    files enabling easy collaboration, efficient management of code evolution (e.g. 
    diff viewing, etc.) 
* What are the top 10 commands? What do they do?
1.  init (initialize a new git repository)
2. add (stages changes to files, prepping them for the next commit)
3. commit (saves the staged changes with a message)
4. push (uploads local commits to a remote repo)
5. pull (fetches changes from a remote repo and merges into current branch)
6. branch (creates, lists or deletes branches in your repo)
7. checkout (switches between different branches or restores files from a specific 
   commit or branch)
8. clone (creates a copy of an existing remote repo on local)
9. status (shows the current state of your working dir giving details about important 
   info)
10. merge (combines changes from one branch into another)
 
* How do you open a PR?
  * after you've finished your work within a repo and successfully pushed your commit,  
    a Pull Request marks the changed work for review among collaborators/project lead 
    before the new 
    work can be saved into the original branch/working repo.

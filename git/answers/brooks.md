## QUESTIONS

- What is git? Why do we need it?

Git is a version control software. We need it to revert to older states of code, collaborate with others, manage branches in our codebase, and see who has done what.

- What are the top 10 commands? What do they do?

1. git add . [stages all changes to be commited]
2. git commit -m "..." [saves staged changes w/ message]
3. git push [pushes current branch to remote repo]
4. git pull [fetches and merges changes from remote repo]
5. git checkout [switches to different branch]
6. git branch [lists branches]
7. git merge [merges another branch into current branch]
8. git init [initialize git repo in current directory]
9. git clone [copies remote repo to local machine]
10. git status [current status of working directory]

- How do you open a PR?

1. push branch to remote repo
2. go to repo on github
3. click Compare & Pull Request button

### What is a terminal? A CLI? Why are they synonymous?

"Terminal" historically referred to a physical "terminal device" that was used as a point of interaction with a computer system, typically involving text input and output. These days it refers to a terminal *emulator* which is a software application that replicates the functionality of those traditional physical terminals.

CLI is a Command-Line Interface, which lets a user type in text commands for the computer to complete. When the user hits send/Enter on the command, the computer executes the instructions immediately. Often this will involve text output, which will be delivered via the same interface.

These two words are almost interchangeable - the terminal is the application that provides a CLI, the CLI is the mode of interaction.

### What is the difference between bash and zsh?

When you sign in at the command line or launch a terminal window on Linux, the system launches a "shell" program. Shells offer a standard way of extending the command line environment. 

BASH is a very popular and well-established shell program. It was first released in 1989 as part of the GNU Project, so it is free software. Bash means "Bourne Again Shell" which is a fun name. If you fire up the terminal on a Mac or in a typical Linux distro you almost always have a bash shell environment.

ZSH is a popular newer shell program. All the bash commands work with it, but it also includes more features like:
- built-in spelling correction
- improved command-line completion
- loadable modules that act as plug-ins for your shell
- global aliases that allow you to alias file names or anything else on the command line instead of just commands


### What is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line?

Command Line = The interface (within a Terminal / Console) where commands are entered by the user

Terminal = program that runs the shell. More specifically it is a kind of "device file" which implements a number of additional commands beyond read and write.In the context of modern CLIs Terminal and Console mean basically the same thing, though on some systems such as Linux and FreeBSD the console appears as several terminals.

Shell = program that takes commands from the Terminal and sends them to the OS for execution

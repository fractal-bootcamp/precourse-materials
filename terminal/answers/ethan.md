* What is a terminal? A CLI? Why are they synonymous?
  * a CLI is a method of interacting via Command Line Interface -- no GUI. They're 
    synonymous because all terminals are text based/TUI.
* What is the difference between bash and zsh?
  * Bash is the Bourne Again Shell. Although it provided modern features compared to 
    its predecessors and offered higher compatibility it doesn't provide the amount of 
    customization and quality of life improvements that Z Shell is known for thus 
    leading to Apple switching it's default shell from bash to zsh in 2019.
* What is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line?
  * The shell interprets the commands a user types into a terminal and executes the 
    appropriate programs along with any additional parameters the user specifies. The 
    terminal gives the user access to the shell via a text based command line interface.

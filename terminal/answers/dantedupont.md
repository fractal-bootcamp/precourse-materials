* What is a terminal? A CLI? Why are they synonymous?

        A terminal is an interface between the user and the computer. Generally this is a text interface, but technically anything that can provide information to a user once a command is executed can be considered a terminal such as a screen or a GUI. 
        A CLI (Command Line Interface) is a text interface between the computer and the user. Its where you are typing the commands and executing them. Since it is a point of user-computer interaction, a CLI is a type of terminal. 

* What is the difference between bash and zsh?

        Both bash and zsh are Bourne-based shells, implementing new features on the then deafult shell for Unix. Bash has become the default shell for most Linux distros as well as macOS. Zsh was released after Bash and includes more funcitonality and features such as built in spell-check and loadable modules. 

* What is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line?

        A Terminal is an interface between a user and a computer, this can take many forms but is often used to refer primarily to text based interfaces, including the Command Line Interface (basically, the line where you would type your commands in a Terminal). The console historically refers to the physical object that a person uses to interact with a computer but nowadays can also refer to the window the terminal is running in or the terminal where boot messages are written. The shell is the program that actually links the terminal to the computer and "translates" the commands into something the computer (or more accurately the Kernel in this case) understands.

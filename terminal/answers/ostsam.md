#### What is a terminal? A CLI? Why are they synonymous?
The term terminal is a holdover from the olden days of computing when you needed a physical device to send and receive text from the computer. Today terminal refers to the emulator window. A CLI is an environment where you can input commands and see the computer's responses. They are synonymous today because the terminals of today will always give you a CLI, and as such they are always used together.

#### What is the difference between bash and zsh?
Bash and zsh are two different command shell interpreters with a different set of features. The shell is a way of extending the command line environment and different ones might be better for different functions. Bash is the older of the two and is still considered the default shell in most operating systems. Zsh is another popular shell which is similar to bash but expands its features, including options such as spelling correction, command line completion, plug-ins, theming, and aliases, among other things.

#### What is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line?
The terminal used to be a piece of hardware as mentioned above, but today the term is used to refer to the emulator window which gives you access to a shell-based CLI, where the user interacts with the computer by inputting commands and seeing text responses. This means that today the two terms are used interchangeably. The console refers to the computer's default terminal. A shell is a program that parses your text commands and invokes other programs.

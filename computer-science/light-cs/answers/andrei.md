## QUESTIONS

- What is time complexity?
time it takes an algorithm to solve a problem - big-O notation used to represent this
- What is space complexity?
amount of memory required by an algorithm 
- What is a pointer and reference?
a pointer points to the literal location of data in memory (often raw int or hexadecimal), while a reference is also an alias but is instead part of a stack. you can reassign pointers but not references.
A "reference," typically implemented as ‚Å†ref keyword in some languages like C#, indirectly points to objects while maintaining a different identity; it acts more abstracted with less precision than pointers but provides an efficient way of passing large or complex data structures without copying their content, thus promoting code cleanliness and resource conservation.
- What is a data structure? What are the types of data structures?
a way of organizing and storing data. includes lists, arrays, graphs, trees, dictionaries, etc.  
- What is a call stack? Why is it important?
call stacks track active function calls within program execution flow. vital for debugging since it helps point to where errors occur, and proper termination for recursive or nested executions

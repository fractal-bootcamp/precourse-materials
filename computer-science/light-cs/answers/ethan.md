## QUESTIONS

* What is time complexity?
  * It measures how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.
* What is space complexity?
  * It measures how much memory an algorithm needs as the input size grows.
* What is a pointer and reference?
  * A pointer stores the address of a variable and a reference is an alias for a variable.
* What is a data structure? What are the types of data structures?
  * A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so it can be used 
    efficiently. Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, Hash Table.
* What is a call stack? Why is it important?
  * The call stack is a special structure that tracks which functions are running in a 
    program and in what order. Without it the program wouldn't know where to return 
    after a function finishes. It allows functions to call other functions and always 
    return to the right place. A call stack also manages error handling catching infinite 
    recursion.

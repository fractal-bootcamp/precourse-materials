- What is time complexity?

A way to describe how fast an algorithm runs as input size grows.
Written in Big O notation

- What is space complexity?

How much memory an algorithm uses as input size grows. Also written in Big O notation.

- What is a pointer and reference?

Pointer (C/C++) = holds a memory address
Reference (JS, Python, etc.) = indirect access to an object/value

- What is a data structure? What are the types of data structures?

# COMPUTING

## QUESTIONS

* What is a computer?
  * A computer is a device that takes input from a user, processes information and 
    performs 
    tasks based on instructions.
* What is an operating system?
  * The OS is like the conductor of an orchestra. The conductor doesnâ€™t play 
    instruments but makes sure every musician (hardware and software) works together 
    in harmony. The key role of an OS other than running applications for a user is 
    talking between the hardware and software layers.
* What is a runtime?
  * A runtime is the environment where a program runs and does its work, providing 
    support to the program, keeping track of what the program is doing, handling 
    errors and bridging the gap between the operating system and its hardware.
* What is memory? RAM? CPU?
  * Not all memory is RAM. A program can be storing something 'in memory' as a general 
    term like on the hard drive longterm. Random Access Memory (RAM) is specifically 
    for temporary storage during when a program is running ...it also provides faster 
    access to values in memory than a hard drive.
  * the CPU is essentially the brains of the computer, making all important decisions, 
    processing information and keeping everything running smoothly. It fetches 
    instructions, processes data, controls the flow of information and talks to the 
    memory, storage and other hardware.
* What is a thread? What is a process?
  * A process is a program in action while a thread is a single path of execution 
    within that process. A process could be thought of as an Office Building while the 
    thread would be the worker active within the building. For example a process would 
    be separate from other processes (buildings) while a thread shares space with 
    other threads (can talk directly with other threads easily).
* What is a browser?
  * A browser is a program that lets you explore and interact with websites.

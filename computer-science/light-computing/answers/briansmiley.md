# COMPUTING

## QUESTIONS

### What is a computer?

A piece of hardware that performs calculations, connects to the internet, stores and displays and manipulates data.

### What is an operating system?

A baseline program that runs on a computer at or just after startup (I guess BIOS runs first) that handles all the basic functionality of allowing a user to access the file system, displays a GUI/CLI, runs basic utilities like taking inputs, etc.

### What is a runtime?

A runtime is a context in which a program runs. It will involve language interpretation, system interfacing, etc. creating the container/communication channel between written code and an operating system.

### What is memory? RAM? CPU?

Memory is blocks of bits that can be used to store data. Random Access Memory is memory allocated for temporary use by currently running programs that need a place to store data that is typically erased or forgotten or overwritten soon after program termination or when the system is shut down. A Central Processing Unit is the main chip performing calculations on a computer system. It contains the circuitry to execute machine code that constitutes much of a operation of a computer (though other components like GPUs handle some things).

### What is a thread? What is a process?

A process refers to the set of entities in the computer system needed to execute a particular program; a block of allocated memory space, the code to be run, and information specifying various other parameters about code execution. A thread is the basic unit of "schedulable processing" within a process. This means that within the right context threads can be executed in parallel, each handling some subsection of tasks involved in their parent process.

### What is a browser?

A computer program which accesses the internet and displays web content.

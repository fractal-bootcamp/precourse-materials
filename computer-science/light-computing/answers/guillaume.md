What is a computer?
A computer is a programmable electronic device that processes information through three fundamental operations: input, processing, and output. It takes in data (input), performs calculations and transformations on that data (processing), and produces results in various forms like visual displays, audio, or stored files (output). This basic cycle of receiving, manipulating, and presenting information enables computers to perform complex tasks from simple calculations to running applications and multimedia.

What is an operating system?
An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and provides services for other programs. It coordinates shared resources like memory, CPU time, and storage between multiple applications, handles communication between software and hardware components, and provides a user interface for interacting with the computer. Without an OS, programs couldn't run simultaneously or access hardware safely.

What is a runtime?
A runtime is the environment in which a program executes. It includes the software components needed to run code written in a specific programming language, such as memory management, garbage collection, and system libraries. Examples include the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or the Node.js runtime for JavaScript.

What is memory? RAM? CPU?
Memory is storage space where data and instructions are held. RAM (Random Access Memory) is temporary, fast memory that stores data currently being used - it's cleared when power is lost. CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the "brain" that executes instructions and performs calculations by fetching, decoding, and executing program instructions.

What is a thread? What is a process?
A process is an independent program running in its own memory space with its own resources. A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process that shares the process's memory and resources. Multiple threads can run concurrently within a single process, allowing for parallel execution of tasks.

What is a browser?
A browser is an application that retrieves, interprets, and displays web content. It translates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into visual web pages, handles user interactions, manages network requests to web servers, and provides security features for safe web browsing.

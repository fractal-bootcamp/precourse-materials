# GENERAL CONCEPTS

## QUESTIONS

- What is the difference between typescript and javascript? Why would you use typescript over javascript?
  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing. You would use TS over JS to write more robust and maintainable code.
- What are the base types used in typescript?
  string, number, boolean, arrays, any (gross)
- What is a generic?
  It is a way to create reusable and flexible components or functions that work with any data type
- What is the difference between an interface and a type?
  They are functionally the same, but we want to use an interface for object-like structures. We generally use a type for things like primitives or unions
- What is a javascript or typescript module? What is a class?
  A module is a file that contains code with its own scope that can be exported and imported throughout the codebase. A class defines the structure and behavior that an object will have.

## ADVANCED

- What is type narrowing?
  It is the process where the compiler refines and specifies a type for a variable.

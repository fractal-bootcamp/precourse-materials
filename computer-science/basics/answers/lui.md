### What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instructions, used for performing calculations or solving problems.

### What is a function?

A function is a "callable unit" - some _thing_ that can be invoked with arguments (input) and usually (but not always) returns an output. A function may perform a view or calculation, or it may perform actions that mutate state.

### What is a variable?

A variable is a named reference. It may refer to to a mutable or immutable value, an object or set of values, or it may even refer to nothing, explicitly (null) or implicitly (undefined).

### What is a data type?

A data type is a classification of a variable or other anonymous (non-referenced) data that defines how that data is interacted with or constrained by a program or language. Interactions and constraints may be permitted operations, maximum or minimum size (total memory allocation), view behaviors, or explicit ranges. 

### What is a web server?

A web server (in software) is a computer program that uses a HTTP(S) request/response model to serve content and perform actions. It controls access to an underlying server, which might interact with application services and databases, call out to other web servers, structure and transform information, etc.

### What is an operator?

A symbol (or short set of symbols) that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational, or logical operation and produce a final result. Let's list them out:

#### Arithmetic Operators

```
+ add
- subtract
* multiply
/ divide
// floor division (round down)
% remainder
++ increment
-- decrement
```

#### Relational Operators
```
== equals
!- not equals
> greater than
< less than
>= greater or equal
<= less or equal
```

#### Logical Operators
```
&& AND
|| OR
! NOT
```

#### Assignment Operator
```
= let
```

#### Bitwise Operator
```
& bitwise AND
| bitwise OR
^ bitwise XOR
~ bitwise NOT
<< bitwise left shift
>> bitwise right shift
```



### What is a character? A string?

A character is a single letter, number, or symbol represented within a byte.

A string is a sequence of characters handled as "just text".


### What is state? Why is it important?

State is the stored information of an application at a given point in time. This information can include data about the programâ€™s variables, user sessions, configurations, the environment it's running in, and more. Essentially, state is a snapshot of various conditions or contexts of a program or device.

It's important to track and respond to user behaviour, the experience seen so far during the session etc.

### What is an interface?

The mechanism for two entities (human and app, or app and app) to interact with each other.

### What is an API?

Application Programming Interface - a defined and published protocol via which you can interact with a software component.

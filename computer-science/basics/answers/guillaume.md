What is data?
It serves as a the "raw material" that softwares work with
At the core it's binary (0s and 1s)
It represents information like text, numbers, images, settings
It can be stored in files, databases, hard drives, cloud storage
It can be formatted in standard ways (like JSON, markdown, etc) for easier use and exchange
It can be compressed or manipulated for efficiency

What is an algorithm?
It's a well defined set of rules or steps to transform data, solve problems or accomplish a sepcific task.
It has specific inputs and outputs (for example input a word and output a sound for text to voice generators)
In most cases it's set to terminate after a finite number of steps.
There is consideration for efficiency, as little steps and energy expenditure as possible.

What is a function?
A function is a named, reusable block of code that performs a specific task. 
It may accept input data (parameters), execute a series of operations, and optionally return a result. 
Functions promote code reusability, readability through descriptive naming, testability, and help manage complexity through abstraction.

What is function scope? What is a block scope? What is global scope?
varaibles created within a function scope are only visible/accessible within that function.
block scope is generally what is between curcly brackets, if, switch conditions or for and while loops.

What is a variable?
A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds data values which can be accessed and modified during program execution. 
In JavaScript, variables can be declared using let, const, or var keywords, and can store various data types including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, and functions.

What is a data type?
A data type defines a format for acceptable data. Data types can be primitive (string, number, boolean, etc.) or complex (objects such as arrays, functions, etc.)
Some coding languages are loose around types (JS is dynamically typed) while others such as Type Script have stronger type enforcement (statically typed).
Data types also determine what operations can be performed on the data.

What is a data structure? What are some examples?
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, storing, and accessing data efficiently in a computer. 
Common examples include arrays (indexed collections), objects (key-value pairs), stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs. 
Each data structure offers different performance characteristics and is suited for specific types of operations and problems.

What is a web server?
A web server is a program that receives requests from web browsers, processes those requests, and sends back the appropriate web content (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) as responses. 
It acts as the intermediary between users' browsers and the website's files and data, making websites accessible over the internet.

What is an operator?
Operators are special characters that trigger specific actions. There are different types of operators:
* arithmetic + - * /
* assignment = += -=
* comparison == === > 
* logical  && || !
and more

What is a character? A string?
In the context of JS, a character is a single letter, digit, symbol, or space. All textual data in JavaScript, including single characters, are represented as strings. A string is a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed in quotation marks (single quotes, double quotes, or backticks).

What is state? Why is it important?
A state is the condition or data values of an application at a specific point in time. 
It's like a snapshot of all the information that the program is currently tracking or remembering.
This is what allows an application to:
be interactive and dynamic
maintain consistency across user intereactions

What is an interface?
Mainly refers to a UI (User Interface) or API (Application Programming Interfaces)
The common thread in all interfaces is that they provide a defined way for two different systems (whether human-computer or computer-computer) to interact while hiding the underlying complexity

What is an API?
It allows different software systems to communicate
It defines the methods and data formats for requests and responses
It provides a way to access functionality or data from another system without needing to understand its internal workings

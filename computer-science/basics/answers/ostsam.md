#### What is data?
Data is information stored on the computer. It can take the form of text, audio, video, images, etc.
#### What is an algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of instructions given to a computer. An algorithm will take an input, follow the steps laid out in the instructions, and produce an output.
#### What is a function?
A function is a set of instructions that accepts arguments and performs a specific task on them. Functions are reusable and they may or may not take an input.
#### What is function scope? What is a block scope? What is global scope?
The function scope means that variables declared inside of a function are only accessible within that function. A block scope similarly prevents a variable from being accessible outside of the block, usually signified by curly brackets {}. Global scope means that variables are accessible from anywhere in the program. In js this is done with var.
#### What is a variable?
A variable holds a value which will later be read and/or modified by a function. In js they are defined through const, let, and var.
#### What is a data type?
Data types are classifications which specify which type of data a variable contains. In js they could be characters, strings, integers, booleans, infinity, objects, null, and undefined.
#### What is a data structure? What are some examples?
Data structures allow you to organize and store data in ways that can be accessed efficiently. Some examples in js include, arrays, objects, and classes.
#### What is a web server?
A web server listens to requests from the web browser (or another type of client), processes the requests, and returns responses.
#### What is an operator?
Operators are symbols that tell the computer to perform an operation. Examples include +, -, *, /, **, %, etc.
#### What is a character? A string?
A character is a single unit of text while a string is a sequence of characters.
#### What is state? Why is it important?
State is the summation of all the stored information at any given point in a program's execution. It will determine how the program will react to inputs.
#### What is an interface?
Interfaces are a boundary which allows different components to communicate.
#### What is an API?
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a collection of tools that allow different systems to communicate. An API provides functions, expected inputs, as well as the returned outputs for said inputs.

#### What are calculations (e.g. “pure functions”)?
A pure function is a function which will always return the same output for the same input and which produces no side effects, that is, it can't alter the state outside of its scope.

#### What are actions (e.g. “side-effectful functions”)?
When a function has side effects, it means that the external state is altered. For example, the alteration of a database.

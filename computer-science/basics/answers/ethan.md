# CS BASICS

## QUESTIONS

* What is data?
  * Information that can be processed or manipulated by computers.
* What is an algorithm?
    * A step-by-step list of instructions designed to solve specific problems by a 
      computer.
* What is a function?
  * A block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task.
* What is function scope? What is a block scope? What is global scope?
  * Function scope is the region within a function where variables are accessible. 
  * Block scope is a smaller region of code within a function where variables specific 
    to that block are manipulated.
  * Global scope is code or variables that can be accessed by any function or block of 
    code within the program.
* What is a variable?
  * A variable is a placeholder value (named storage location) we are reserving within 
    the program's memory to be referenced later.
* What is a data type?
  * A way to define a special type of value a variable can hold and how the computer 
    interprets & processes it.
* What is a data structure? What are some examples?
  * An organizational method for storing and arranging data in a computer's memory, 
    like an array, list, dictionary (a key/value pair), stack, queue, or tree.
* What is a web server?
  * A computer that stores websites' files and delivers content to users' browsers 
    over the internet.
* What is an operator?
  * A mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.)
* What is a character? A string?
  * A character is an individual unit/symbol used to represent a letter, number or 
    control code. A string literal is a grouping of characters
* What is state? Why is it important?
  * State is a way for a program to track change to an object over time -- important 
    because it's how the condition of data will be tracked throughout a system. i.e. from 
    the client to the server.
* What is an interface?
  * Specifications that components use to interact with each other within an application.
* What is an API?
  * It stands for Application Programming Interface. It's how a set of rules and 
    specifications can be standardized, making it easier for information to communicate 
    between systems & applications.

## ADVANCED

* What are calculations (e.g. “pure functions”)?
  * Calculations (pure functions) are functions that work like a calculator - they take inputs, do math on them, and give you the same answer every time, without changing anything else.
* What are actions (e.g. “side-effectful functions”)?
  * Actions (side effects) are when a function does something besides just calculating 
    and giving you an answer back. e.g. (making a network request, changing a variable 
    other parts of your program use, printing something to the screen)

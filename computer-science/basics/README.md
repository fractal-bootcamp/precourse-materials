# BASICS

## QUESTIONS

- What is data?
  A collection of values that convey information.
- What is an algorithm?
  A set of instructions that is designed to accomplish a specific task.
- What is a function?
  A callable unit of software logic that has a well-defined interface and behavior that can be invoked multiple times.
- What is function scope? What is a block scope? What is global scope?
  In general, scope determines the visibility and/or accessibility of a variable or resource in code. Function scope is visible and attainable within that specific function and any other functions within it.
  Block scoped variables are visible/attainable within conditionals or loops. Global scoped variables can be used anywhere
- What is a variable?
  It is an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name
- What is a data type?
  It is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells the program how to interpret its value.
- What is a data structure? What are some examples?
  It is a way of organizing data in an efficient and accessible manner. Some examples in JavaScript/TypeScript are arrays, maps, sets, and objects.
- What is a web server?
  It is software and hardware that accepts requests via HTTP(s)
- What is an operator?
  It is a symbol or keyword that tells the computer what operation it should perform on values or variables
- What is a character? A string?
  A character is a basic unit of information that represents a letter, number, or symbol and a string is a sequence of characters.
- What is state? Why is it important?
  It is the current condition or configuration of a program or system at a specific time.
- What is an interface?
  A shared boundary across with two or more separate components of a system exchange information
- What is an API?
  An API (application programming interface) is a set of rules and specifications that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with one another.

## ADVANCED

- What are calculations (e.g. “pure functions”)?
  Calculations are functions that will return the same output (given the same input) and have no side effects
- What are actions (e.g. “side-effectful functions”)?
  An action is an operation or task that a program performs in response to an event or input

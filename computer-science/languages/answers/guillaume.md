What is a programming language?
A programming language is a formal system of communication that allows humans to give instructions to a computer. It consists of a set of rules (syntax and semantics) for writing programs, which are sequences of instructions that tell the computer how to perform specific tasks. Programming languages enable developers to create software, automate processes, and solve problems by expressing logic in a way that computers can interpret and execute. Examples include Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.


What is a software framework?
A software framework is a reusable set of libraries or tools that provides a structure and common foundation for developing applications. It offers pre-written code, components, and guidelines to help developers build software more efficiently and consistently. Frameworks often handle common tasks (like database access, user authentication, or web routing) so you can focus on the unique parts of your application. Examples include React (for web interfaces), Django (for web backends), and Ruby on Rails.

What is the difference between a programming language vs a framework?
A programming language is the fundamental tool you use to write instructions for a computer (like Python, JavaScript, or Java). A framework, on the other hand, is a collection of pre-built code and tools—written in a programming language—that helps you build applications faster and with best practices.
Programming language: The “words and grammar” you use to communicate with the computer.
Framework: A “template” or “scaffold” built with that language to help you build things more easily.

What is the difference between a procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming language?
Procedural programming: Organizes code as a sequence of instructions or procedures (functions). It focuses on actions and the order in which they happen. Example: C.
Object-oriented programming (OOP): Organizes code around objects, which combine data and behavior. It uses concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. Example: Java, Python.
Functional programming: Focuses on writing pure functions (no side effects) and treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It emphasizes immutability and avoids changing state. Example: Haskell, parts of JavaScript.

What is the difference between a typed and non-typed language?
Typed language: Variables have a specific data type (like integer, string, etc.), and the language enforces rules about how types are used. Errors can occur if you try to use the wrong type. Examples: Java (statically typed), Python (dynamically typed but still typed).
Non-typed language: This term is less common, but usually refers to languages that do not enforce types strictly, or where types are not explicitly declared. In practice, almost all modern languages have some notion of types, but some (like JavaScript) are more flexible and allow variables to change type.

What is the difference between a compiled and interpreted language? Is JS compiled or interpreted?
Compiled language: The code you write is transformed (compiled) into machine code by a compiler before it runs. This machine code is what the computer actually executes. Examples: C, C++.
Interpreted language: The code is read and executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, rather than being compiled ahead of time. Examples: Python, Ruby.
JavaScript: Traditionally, JavaScript was considered an interpreted language, but modern JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome) actually compile JavaScript to machine code just before running it (a process called Just-In-Time compilation). So, JavaScript is both interpreted and compiled, depending on the context.

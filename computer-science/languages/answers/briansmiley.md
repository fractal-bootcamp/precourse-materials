# LANGUAGES

## QUESTIONS

## What is a programming language##?

A set of standards, syntactical rules, etc which can be transformed into instructions for an OS, runtime, or hardware to read/write data, perform calculations and take actions.

## What is a software framework?

A set of software tools, libraries, language(s), or set of standardized protocols used for building or deploying software. 

## What is the difference between a programming language vs a framework?

A programming language defines syntax and a certain scope of operations for specifying program behavior, but is usually relatively limited in terms of the built-in capacities available.  A framework is going to consist of thousands or millions of lines of written code that constitute modules, libraries etc. that give handles to much more complex operatons than a language that starts off at the level of creating a variable, writing a loop, etc.

## What is the difference between a procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming language?
Procedural langauges are focused on sequential, ~linear program structure that follows a somewhat human-intuitive style of creating blocks of code for specific procedures and fitting them together in sequences, loops, and conditional execution structure. Object orientated languages, predictable enough, are oriented around the concept of a software object, a self-contained, named, reusable instance of a particular structure of code (i.e. a class) that is well suited for applications where similar structures are created and accessed in repeated ways. Functional language orients around the design conceit of separating code by the purpose of different functions. Particularly functional programming draws a hard distinction between data, calculations (functions which take data and return new data without side effects) and actions (functions whose purpose is to create side effects).

## What is the difference between a typed and non-typed language?

Typed (or statically typed) and non-typed (or dynamically typed) languages differ in how they approach/enforce data types of variables. In typed languages, variables are declared with and expected to adhere to a specific data type (int, float, char, array, etc.). This makes for less flexibility in writing code, but makes the code less prone to errors by preventing misunderstandings about what kind of data is being fed into a function vs what that function is designed to expect and use. Non-typed languages are more flexible, allowing the creation and passing around of variables without an eye to what type they are, which is less to write and keep track of, but allows for errors that might occur if the wrong kind of data is passed to the wrong kind of function, or for errors that aren't caught until runtime vs at compilation.

## ADVANCED

- What is the difference between a compiled and interpreted language? Is JS compiled or interpreted?

Compiled code is transformed from the text-based programming language instructions down into machine code native to the hardware on which it is run (e.g. C code getting compiled into Assembly instructions). Interpreted languages, like JS and Python, are instead run by an interpreter that more directly runs the high level code line-by-line. I'm not sure there's strong material difference between writing interpreted vs. compiled code, at least until one gets into more advanced territory where there are performance differences because of different levels of abstraction.

# LANGUAGES

## QUESTIONS

- What is a programming language?
a formal set of instructions that can be directly executed by computers to perform tasks or solve probleems algorithmically. 
- What is a software framework?
pre-written code that handles common tasks or infrastructure (typically for applications)
- What is the difference between a programming language vs a framework?
one is the actual language interacting with computers, the other is a sort of extension of a language (like react of JS + JSX etc.) that provides infrastructure for common tasks.
- What is the difference between a procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming language?
procedural: focused on routines/sequences of code (C)
object-oriented: centered around objects (entities with attributes (data) and behaviors (functions)) (Java)
functional: where computation is the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding changing states and mutable data/side effects. uses recursion instead of loops (Haskell, sort of Scala/Clojure)
- What is the difference between a typed and non-typed language?
typed languages have explicitly declared types for variables/objects etc. non-typed languages do not, like vanilla JS.

## ADVANCED

- What is the difference between a compiled and interpreted language? Is JS compiled or interpreted?
compiled languages translate code into machine code before execution for speed optimization. interpreted languages execute instructions line by line using an interpreter that translates them on the fly (slower, but provides immediate feedback during dev). JS is an interpreted language that uses just in time (JIT) compilation in web browsers (i think) while a language like C is compiled before being executed.

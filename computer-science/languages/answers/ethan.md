# LANGUAGES

## QUESTIONS

* What is a programming language?
  * The programming language actually tells
    the computer what to do.
* What is a software framework?
  * A framework is a set of tools/pre-written code/guidelines built on top of the
    programming language to help
    build specific kinds of applications.
* What is the difference between a programming language vs a framework?
  *  The difference is like the framework is a house building kit with instructions. 
     The language is like the ingredients to build the house, but you do it all from 
     scratch.
* What is the difference between a procedural, object-oriented, and functional 
  programming language?
  1. Procedural: code that's organized into procedures/routines focusing on a sequence 
     of steps to perform tasks.
  2. OOP: code that's organized around objects aka bundles of data and behaviors. 
     Objects often represent real-world things or concepts defining classes to create 
     objects that interact with each other.
  3. Functional: code that's organized around pure functions, meaning they always give 
     the same output for the same input and don't change anything outside of that 
     function. In this paradigm you combine functions with the goal of avoiding 
     changing data unexpectedly or using loops.
* What is the difference between a typed and non-typed language?
  * A typed language enforces rules about how data types are used. Most of the time a 
    more strongly typed language can prevent bugs earlier in the dev cycle.

## ADVANCED

* What is the difference between a compiled and interpreted language? Is JS compiled 
  or interpreted?
  * JavaScript is an interpreted language like Python, commonly considered scripting 
    languages. These languages are read by an interpreter engine and 'interpreted' line by 
    line top to bottom left to right JavaScript can be "Just In Time" compiled within 
    a modern browser via an engine (Chrome V8, SpiderMonkey, etc.). However, broadly 
    speaking, a compiled language translates the code all at once by a compiler into a
    self-contained executable file. This usually results in a faster runtime, a
    program that can be distributed easier and catches errors 
    upfront before the end-user interacts with the program.

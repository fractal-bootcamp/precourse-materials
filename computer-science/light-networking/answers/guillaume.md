What is an IP Address? What does IP stand for?
IP stands for Internet Protocol. An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a network, allowing devices to locate and communicate with each other. It's like a postal address for computers - IPv4 addresses look like 192.168.1.1, while IPv6 addresses are longer alphanumeric strings.

What does HTTP stand for? What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol - it's the protocol used for transferring web pages and data between browsers and web servers. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the encrypted version that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit. HTTPS prevents eavesdropping and tampering, making it essential for secure transactions and sensitive information.
What is a URL? What is DNS?

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet, like https://www.example.com/page. DNS (Domain Name System) is the system that translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand - it's like a phonebook for the internet.
